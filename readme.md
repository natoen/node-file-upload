# Node File Upload

A simple Node.js app demonstrating data upload using [FormData] and [Multer].

## Instructions:
- To start our app we need to do an `npm install` then an `npm start` 
- Use Chrome or Firefox and go to `localhost:8000`
- If you are using Safari, just change the `const` and `let` to a `var` and the arrow functions to a regular one in `index.html`
